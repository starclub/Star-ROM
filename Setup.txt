Starting to set up your Star-ROM disc.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting up your Autorun.inf
-------------------------------------
1. Open Autorun.inf with your favorite text editor.
2. Edit the text "Star-ROM Sample" in the label and replace it with your project's name. Then, do the same with the action.
3. Save the Autorun.inf and exit the editor.
4. You're done with Autorun.inf.

Compile a .SWF of your Scratch Project
----------------------------------------
1. Save an .SB2 of a Scratch Project
2. Go to http://junebeetle.github.io/converter/online/
3. Upload your project
4. Check the box that says "Show Green Flag Bar"
5. Click "Convert to SWF"
6. Save the file in the Star-ROM directory as "project.swf"
7. That's all for setting up the project, but the Star-ROM is still not done.

Adding an icon
------------------------------------------

To add an icon, you must find or make an .ico file.
We reccommend going to iconarchive.com to download an icon.
Once you have your icon, save it as "icon.ico" in the Star-ROM directory.

Burning your Star-ROM disc
------------------------------------------
This is the final part to making your Star-ROM disc.
1. Go to MagicISO.com and download MagicISO.
2. Run the installer and follow the directions to install MagicISO.
3. Once it is done installing, click "Finish" in the installer and open MagicISO if you haven't yet.
4. You can register or use the free version, so you can pick which one.
5. Navigate your way to the Star-ROM directory in the MagicISO window.
6. The files should appear to the right of all of the folders.
7. Drag all of the files in the Star-ROM directory in the empty section that's right above the Star-ROM files.
8. Click "File" in the upper left corner.
9. Click "Save As"
10. Save the .iso wherever you want.
11. Make sure you have a blank CD inserted into your disc drive. DVD's and Blu-Ray discs will not work.
12. Click "Tools", which is right next to "File".
13. Click "Burn CD/DVD With ISO" While it says DVD's are an option, they are incompatible with Star-ROM.
14. Open the ISO you just made and click "Burn it!"
15. Once it is done burning, you have officially made a Star-ROM disc! To find out how to use it, read Test.txt
